This is my personal landing page hosted with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
using [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) at https://enpaul.net. Being a static site it
should be hostable nearly anywhere.

The `_archive` directory has all the previous iterations of this website, dating back
even before it was in source control. The `_archive` directory could be considered
documentation of my indecisive nature.

The `_error` directory has self-contained custom error pages for displaying `HTTP 400`
and `HTTP 500` errors in the style of the rest of the site.
